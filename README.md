# DiscordC2
Custom Discord C2 leveraging Iron Python
<hr>
This is a personal project i made to practice Python and Iron Python for Discord C2 development. The project itself is in early stages and there is a lot of improvements to be made.
<p></p>

What can it do?
- Custom AMSI patching
- In-memory assembly execution
- Custom commands using python via HTTP requests
- Upload and Download(exfil)
- Advanced exfiltration using Encryption
- Managing Command and Beaconing timers
- Command editing and retry function
- Logging
- Custom Decrypton

Future Plans:
- Code obfuscation
- Fetch the whole code remotely instead of providing it all
- Custom implant
- Better logging and error handling
